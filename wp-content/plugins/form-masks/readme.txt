Plugin to Form Mask is a plugin that makes the developer's time to create mask for forms in general, both forms of plugins and for front-end.

== Description ==

Plugin to mask forms as CNPJ, ID, social security number, telephone numbers with area code or without DDD, from 11:10 digits Standards. This plugin funiona with all forms that allow to pass as a parameter a CSS class.

Make the most of this plugin because it was created when there was a need to do this quickly and efficiently. I hope you enjoy.

**Note: This plugin requires PHP 5.3 or higher to be activated.**
